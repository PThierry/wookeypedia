Libstd FAQ
==========

Are there helper functions to manipulate registers in userspace?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! A lot of helper functions and macros have been written to help
interacting with registers.
This API is in the libstd regutils.h header. Applications can include
this header directly in order to use it.
