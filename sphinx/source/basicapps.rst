Basic applications
==================

This section describes a simple application to make the four LEDs
of the STM32 Discovery F407 blinking and reacting to the press
of the blue button on the board.

The purpose of this example is to show how a single application can interact
with the GPIOs, in both output mode (with the LEDs: PD12, PD13, PD14 and PD15)
and input mode (with the push Button: PA0).
