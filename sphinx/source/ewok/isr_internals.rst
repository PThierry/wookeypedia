About EwoK IRQ and ISR internals
================================

About IRQ, ISR, and userspace confinment
----------------------------------------

Some hardware devices such as the smart card generate interrupts that must be
acknowledged within a very tight time frame to avoid timeouts.
Other components like the touch screen put pressure on the kernel with interrupts bursts.
To deal with these constraints, we designed a simple yet effective system to
quickly acknowledge interrupts and to limit as much as possible the overhead
of the user mode drivers.

In EwoK, a driver is typically  composed of a main
thread, which implements all the driver logic, and one or several *user
Interrupt Service Routine (user ISR)* to handle the hardware interrupts.
User ISRs execution takes place in user mode,
with the associated task permissions and memory layout.

Usually, a user ISR performs only two things: it acknowledges the
hardware by reading or writing in some registers and it sets some variables or
some shared structures to signal to the main thread that an event happened.

About ISR postponing versus task scheduling
-------------------------------------------

It should be highlighted that a user ISR is scheduled with the highest priority.
As a consequence, it must be fast enough to avoid
hindering treatment of subsequent hardware interrupts. In that way, it is very
similar to the *bottom-half* part of interrupt handlers found in
monolithic kernels.

When a hardware interrupt is triggered, the kernel traps it and checks if
it must be handled by a user task. If that is the case, the
kernel updates a queue structure, managed by the so-called *softirq* module,
so that the related user ISR can be scheduled afterward.
If an interrupt is triggered while a user ISR is already executing,
this interrupt is not lost thanks to the *softirq* queueing mechanism
that defers its treatment.

In this design, user ISRs are executed asynchronously.
A potential problem is the induced latency in the handling of hardware interrupts.

Previous figure describes a typical scheduling scheme during an IRQ burst.
The *posthook* mechanism has been introduced to address this issue.

IRQ, ISR and Posthooks
----------------------

Posthook instructions define a restricted high level language that allow to
read or to set some bits in specific hardware registers when an interrupt occurs.
For each kind of interrupt, a driver can use such \textit{posthook} instructions,
that are synchronously interpreted and executed by the kernel, in order to
quickly acknowledge hardware interrupts.
