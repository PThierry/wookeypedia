EwoK ressource reconfiguration API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Synopsis
""""""""

The ressource (GPIOs, DMA, etc.) reconfiguration request is done by the
sys_cfg() syscall familly. The sys_cfg() familly support the following
prototypes::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t value);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_GET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t *val);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_UNLOCK_EXTI, uint8_t gpioref)
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF, dma_t*dma, dma_reconf_mask_t reconfmask);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD, uint32_t dma_id);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_DISABLE, uint32_t dma_id);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_MAP, uint8_t dev_id);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_UNMAP, uint8_t dev_id);
   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_RELEASE, uint8_t dev_id);


sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET)
"""""""""""""""""""""

GPIOs are not directly mapped in the task's memory. As a consequence, setting the GPIO output value, for
GPIO in output mode, must be done using a syscall.
There is no need to use the entire GPIO structure (or parent device_t structure) to set a GPIO. As describred in
the ``sys_init(INIT_DEVACCESS)`` explanations, each GPIO has a kref identifier. This identifier is used here
to identify the GPIO when asking the kernel for an action on it.

Setting an output GPIO previously registered is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t value);

The value set is the one given in third argument.

.. important::
  The GPIO to set must have been previously declared in the initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_GET)
"""""""""""""""""""""

In the same way, getting a GPIO value for a GPIO configured in input mode is done using a syscall.

GPIOs are not directly mapped in the task's memory. As a consequence,i in the same way has for ``sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET)``
getting a GPIO value for a GPIO in input mode must be done using a syscall.

In the same maner, there is no need to use the entire GPIO structure (or parent device_t structure) to set a GPIO. As describred in
the ``sys_init(INIT_DEVACCESS)`` explanations, each GPIO has a kref identifier. This identifier is used here
to identify the GPIO when asking the kernel for an action on it.

Getting an input value of a GPIO previously registered is done with the following API::

The value read is set in the syscall third argument.

.. important::

sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_UNLOCK_EXTI)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable in ISR mode

There are times when external interrupts may:
   * arrise only one time and need to be muted voluntary for a given amount of time
   * be unstable and generate uncontrolled bursts, when the external IP is not clean and has hardware bugs

For these two above cases, the EwoK kernel support a specific GPIO configuration which permits, when an EXTI interrupt is configure, to choose whether:

   * the EXTI line is shut at handler time, by the kernel. The user ISR will be executed but there will be no more EXTI interrupts pending on the interrupt line.
   * the EXTI line is not shut, and the EXTI is only acknowledged. The EXTI source can continue to emit other interrupts and the userspace ISR handler will be executed for each of them

The choice is done using the `exti_lock` field of the gpio structure, using wether:

   * GPIO_EXTI_UNLOCKED value: the EXTI line is not muted and will continue to arrise when the external HW IP emit an event on its EXTI line
   * GPIO_EXTI_LOCKED value: the EXTI line is muted each time the interrupt arrise. As a consequence, the userspace task need to unmutte it voluntary using a specific syscall, otherwhise no other EXTI are received.

To unmutte a given EXTI interrupt, a userspace task uses the ``sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_UNLOCK_EXTI)`` syscall. This syscall as the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_EXTI_UNLOCK, uint8_t gpioref);

The gpioref value is the kref identifier of the GPIO, like the one used in the other GPIO manipulation syscalls. Unlocking the EXTI line is a synchronous syscall.

.. important::
  The GPIO value to get must have been previously declared in the initialization phase.



sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF)
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable in ISR mode

In a generic DMA channel usage, it is a standard behavior to reconfigure a part of the DMA channel
informations. This is for example the case for input or output buffers when using direct access mode
with chained data.

EwoK allows some reconfiguration of DMA channels, in a controlled way. Only some fields of the ``dma_t``
can be reconfigured. This is the case of:

   * ISR handlers address
   * Input buffer address (for memory to peripheral mode)
   * Output buffer address (for peripheral to memory mode)
   * Buffer size
   * DMA mode (direct, FIFO or circular)
   * DMA priority

In order to reconfigure only a subset of theses fields, a mask exists specifying
which field(s) need(s) to be reconfigured.

As these fields are a part of the ``dma_t`` structure (see Ewok kernel API technical refence documentation), the
syscall requires this entire structure. This is also require to determine which DMA channel is
targeted by this syscall, by using the DMA id set in this structure by the kernel at initialization time.

Reconfiguring a part of a DMA stream is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF, dma_t*dma, dma_reconf_mask_t reconfmask);


.. hint::
   The easiest way to use this syscall is to keep the dma_tÂ structure used during the initialization
   phase and to update it during the nominal phase

.. important::
   The DMA that need to be reconfigured must have been previously declared in the initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD)
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable in ISR mode

There is some time when we only want the DMA controller to restart a copy action, without modifying
any of its properties. In that later case, only a reload is needed. The kernel only need to identify
the DMA controller and stream, and doesn't need a whole DMA structure. The task can then
use only the ``id`` field of the ``dma_t`` structure.

Reloading a DMA stream is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD, uint32_t dma_id);

.. important::
  The DMA that need to be reload must have been previously declared in the initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_DISABLE)
""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable in ISR mode

It is possible to disable a DMA stream. In that case, the DMA is stopped and can be re-enabled only by calling
one of sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD) or sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF) syscalls.

This is usefull for DMA streams in circular mode, as they never stop while the software doesn't ask them to.

Disabling a DMA stream is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_DISABLE, uint32_t dma_id);

.. important::
  The DMA that need to be disabled must have been previously declared in the initialization phase.

sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_MAP)
""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable only in main thread mode

It is possible to declare a device as voluntary mapped (field ``map_mode`` of the *device_t* structure.
This field can be set to the following values:

   * DEV_MAP_AUTO
   * DEV_MAP_VOLUNTARY

When using DEV_MAP_AUTO, the device is automatically mapped to the task address space when finishing the
initialization phase, and is keeped mapped until the end of the task lifecycle.

When using DEV_MAP_VOLUNTARY, the device is not mapped by the kernel and the task has to map the device
itself. In that case, the device is mapped using this very syscall.

Voluntary mapped devices permit to map, configure and unmap in sequence more than the maximum number of
concurrently mapped devices. It also permit to avoid mapping devices for which concurrent mapping is
dangerous (e.g. concatenated mapping).

Mapping a device is done using the device id, hosted in the ``id`` field of the *device_t* structure,
which is set by the kernel at registration time.

Mapping a device is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_MAP, uint8_t dev_id);

.. important::
   Declaring a voluntary mapped device require a specific permission: PERM_RES_MEM_DMAP

.. note::
   mapping a device requires a call to the scheduler, in order to reconfigure the MPU, this action is costly

sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_UNMAP)
""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable only in main thread mode

When using DEV_MAP_VOLUNTARY, a previoulsy voluntary mapped device can be unmap by the task.
Unmapping a device free a MPU slot when the task requires more than the maximum number of concurrently
usable MPU slots by managing devices in sequence in the main thread.

.. important::
   while the device is configured, device's ISR still map the device, even if it is unmap from the main thread

.. important::
   unmapping a device does not mean disable it, the hardware device still works and emit IRQs that are handled
   by the task's registered ISR

.. note::
   unmapping a device requires a call to the scheduler, in order to reconfigure the MPU, this action is costly

Unmapping a device is done using the device id, hosted in the ``id`` field of the *device_t* structure,
which is set by the kernel at registration time.

Unmapping a device is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_UNMAP, uint8_t dev_id);


sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_RELEASE)
""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::
   Synchronous syscall, executable only in main thread mode

A task may want, at a given time of its lifecycle, to stop to use a given device. This can be done by
requesting the kernel to release the device using its device descriptor.
The device is then fully deactivated (including associated RCC clock and interrupts) and fully removed from the task context.

Because of the EwoK task lifecycle paradigm including a separated declarative phase (so called initialization phase), a released
device should never be allocated by another task. This can only happend if the device is released by a given task before
another task has finished its initialization phase.

.. danger::
   You should **not** use nominal and initializing phase overlapping between tasks to avoid potential unvoluntary device sharing
   associated to device release, Take care to synchronize init sequence correctly.
   The kernel **does not** clear the device registers at release time

Releasing a device is done with the following API::

   e_syscall_ret sys_cfg(CFG_DEV_RELEASE, uint8_t dev_id);
